# Introduction

The research question is this: is there a difference in the average amount of alcohol consumed per week by students who sit in row 1, row 2 or row3 of the UCdavis classroom

$H_0$: There is no difference between the average number of drinks imbibed between people based on the row they sit in.

$H_A$: The average number drinks is different between at least two rows.   


# Methods

Data from UC Davis: Seat is categorical, and alcohol is numerical, so we use the Numerical~Cat helper file
